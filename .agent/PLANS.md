# ExecPlan Standard

An ExecPlan is required for any WEOS task involving:

- database schema;
- migration;
- publication;
- learner exposure;
- authority;
- more than one backend module;
- cross-backend/frontend change;
- controlled AI application;
- high-risk governance behavior.

Each ExecPlan must include:

## Purpose

State the exact invariant the work will make true.

## Approved Authority

List the approval record, decision document, branch, and commit that authorize
the work. If authority is absent or unresolved, stop before implementation.

## Current Behavior

Summarize observed runtime and documentation behavior with file references.

## Required Invariant

Define the invariant in testable terms.

## Scope

List included behavior and excluded behavior.

## Files Expected To Change

Name expected files or directories before editing.

## Prohibited Changes

List runtime, data, API, schema, or documentation changes that must not happen.

## Data Model Implications

Describe schema, migration, backfill, and compatibility effects. State `None`
when none are expected.

## API Implications

Describe DTO, response, route, and client contract effects. State `None` when
none are expected.

## Migration Plan

Describe migration order, reversibility, and data safety. State `None` when no
migration is authorized.

## Compatibility Strategy

Explain how legacy reads/writes remain safe during transition.

## Testing Strategy

List exact checks, tests, and fixtures.

## Rollback/Recovery

Explain how to revert safely or recover from partial application.

## Progress

Maintain a short checklist while working.

## Discoveries

Record new facts found during implementation.

## Decisions

Record decisions made inside the authorized scope only.

## Remaining Risks

Record unresolved authority, technical, data, or verification risks.
